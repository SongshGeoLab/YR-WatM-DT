# Yellow River Basin Water Resource Management Digital Twin System - Storyline

## P1: Study Area and Historical Context

In this digital twin case study, our research area is the Yellow River Basin in northern China, the world's fifth-longest river with a disproportionately small catchment area and river discharge relative to its length. Although water is scarce, the Yellow River is rich in sediment, making it extremely difficult to manage. The high sediment load is primarily due to intensive human activities and development over thousands of years, which continuously reduced forest coverage, leading to increasingly severe soil erosion and exceptionally high sediment content in the river.

Through our historical data analysis, you can see the changes in sediment load: at its peak, the Yellow River's sediment discharge was almost comparable to that of the Amazon River, despite having much lower water flow. This massive sediment accumulation reduces downstream channel stability, raises riverbeds, and leads to more frequent flooding. Many historical dynasties were deeply troubled by Yellow River flood management, earning it the reputation as "China's Sorrow."

In recent years, the central government has conducted large-scale afforestation in the middle reaches to reduce downstream flood risks and soil erosion. You can see that forest coverage has significantly recovered from its historical low point, and combined with other management measures, sediment levels have gradually returned to relatively stable conditions.

## P2: Climate Change and Water Availability

Based on our multi-source analysis integrating observations, data, and models, these related human activities, particularly land use changes, have dramatically altered the entire basin's water cycle processes, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff. However, under future climate change scenarios, the challenges of sustainable water resource management remain daunting.

Our model provides predictions for two typical future climate change scenarios: RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways describing different greenhouse gas emission scenarios). Under the most optimistic RCP2.6 scenario, the region's average temperature will increase by approximately 0.9°C. This warming will increase glacial meltwater, leading to greater surface water availability. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the region's average temperature will increase by approximately 1.5°C, with surface water availability also increasing accordingly.

Building on this foundation, the Chinese government is planning a South-North Water Transfer strategy to transport large quantities of water from the Yangtze River in the south to this basin, which will further enhance future water resource availability.

## P3: Population Changes and Water Demand

While surface water availability increases, population is decreasing. Due to currently low fertility rates, the population will peak around 2030, meaning domestic water consumption will also peak a few years later. However, the Chinese government is implementing various population policies to promote fertility increases.

According to our most optimistic scenario estimates, even if the fertility rate increases to 1.8, water consumption will still peak around 2033. Meanwhile, China's current dietary structure consumes large amounts of meat and protein, with livestock and fisheries water demand not peaking until around 2050. Therefore, if we simultaneously encourage people to adopt more balanced, vegetable-rich diets, the water consumption increase from population growth will be greatly reduced. This means that the population policies being promoted by the government will not be significantly constrained by water resources.

## P4: Irrigation Efficiency and Industrial Water Use

Another positive development is that irrigation efficiency continues to improve, so irrigation water demand is rapidly decreasing. Currently, the Yellow River Basin's water-saving irrigation ratio, including hardened channel irrigation, drip irrigation, and pipe irrigation, is around 80%, which is absolutely world-leading. Therefore, there's limited room for further optimization, but combined with reduced farmland area, future irrigation water consumption is expected to decrease by 1.16 billion cubic meters.

On the other hand, industrial water demand continues to rise, related to China's increasing industrialization level. A significant portion of industrial water use comes from cooling water for traditional energy sources (such as power generation). This water consumption will be influenced by the future proportion of thermal power in China's energy structure. As is well known, China is vigorously promoting renewable energy to replace traditional energy. China's current thermal power proportion is about 60%, and reducing it to 40% is absolutely possible. If it decreases further, this water consumption will also significantly decrease.

## P5: Overall Water Demand Trends

Let's examine the future overall water resource demand predictions. Among the four categories of water use, only industrial water use will grow long-term, while others will decrease. Agricultural irrigation has always been the most water-consuming sector, but the proportions of these various sectors will continuously change with the policy parameters mentioned above. As we expect, this provides decision-makers with an excellent tool to see which aspects their policies should focus on influencing in the future.

Since the water demand decrease in other sectors exceeds the increase in industrial sector water demand, the total water consumption in our future region will inevitably reach a peak at some point. Of course, the timing varies according to different parameters. According to our model predictions, this will generally occur between 2035 and 2050. The factor that most significantly influences this timing is the proportion of thermal power. Therefore, our policy recommendation is to vigorously develop clean energy industries.

## P6: Ecological Flow Requirements

In summary, the Yellow River Basin's future water stress will inevitably continue to ease. However, the long-term high-intensity development and lack of regulation in the past have caused numerous ecological problems for this great river. Future water demand reduction will only alleviate ecological problems, not completely solve them.

For example, according to expert estimates, the Yellow River requires at least 1.74 billion cubic meters of ecological flow annually to ensure sediment balance, wetland ecology, and fish spawning. This is a critical safety line that has barely been maintained in the past. For more resilient ecology, the normal value should be 2.32 billion cubic meters, and ideally 3.48 billion cubic meters. Basin management departments have also proposed basic laws for ecological flow guarantees, requiring it to account for more than 20% of runoff. If we can guarantee 30%, we would still need decades to reach this ecological safety line. A more direct method is to advance the South-North Water Transfer project we mentioned earlier to meet a large portion of water demand and immediately solve ecological problems.

## P7: Water Stress Index and Policy Recommendations

Finally, we have a comprehensive indicator, the Water Stress Index, to provide policymakers with insights into how different water resource management scenarios affect the Yellow River Basin's ecological security. Generally speaking, 0.4 is an internationally recognized safety line, while 0.6 is already a sign of severe stress. The Yellow River Basin has historically experienced high water stress, but under many future water resource management policies, we have hope of reversing this situation.

If we don't implement any radical policy measures, water stress will take decades to fall below the warning line. However, if we implement particularly radical water resource management policies, this timeline could be advanced to the 2030s. A more realistic future scenario that balances economic development with sustainability suggests that by the 2040s, we will comprehensively achieve water and ecological security in the Yellow River Basin.
